# SourceCodeTokenizer

This C# solution/project is to tokenize the unified dataset, so that it can be fed into the NN.

The source code is practically forked from [Source Code 'Learning to Represent Edits'](https://github.com/microsoft/msrc-dpu-learning-to-represent-edits) and adjusted to this use-case.
